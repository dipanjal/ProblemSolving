== What is Merge Sort ?
Merge sort is one of the _most efficient_ sorting algorithms `O(nLog(n))`. It works on the principle of *_Divide and Conquer_*. Merge sort repeatedly breaks down a list into several sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.

==Merge Sort

.MergeSort(int[] arr)
****
Sidebars contain aside text and are subject to normal substitutions.
****

.MergeSort(arr[])
****
If arr.length < 2 return ;

. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:
middle m = arr.length / 2

. Call mergeSort for left half array leftArray[0...m]
.. Recirsive Call mergeSort(leftArray)
... continue util the rightArray reach at atomic level

. Call mergeSort for right half array rightArray[m+1...n]:
.. Call mergeSort(rightArray)
... continue util the rightArray reach at atomic level

. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
Call merge(arr[], leftArr[], rightAr[])
